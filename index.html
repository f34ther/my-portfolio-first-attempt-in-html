    <p>Why a software engineer? <br> That is an excellent question. Honestly, I <em>don't</em> have an answer.
        I was never into computers when I was growing up, sports like basketball was more my speed. To be completely
        candid,
        I did this on a whim. I know that problem solving and attention to details are two of the things that I excel
        in,
        and from what I've found, that's all you need for coding. Everything else can be taught. I'm only barely
        scratching the
        surface here, just dipping my toes in the water for coding, but I am really enjoying it!

    <p>My favorite word is: <strong>Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia</strong>. It is the fear of big words and it
        kills me because
        if you have this phobia, you literally can't say it outloud. Don't believe me? Look it up
