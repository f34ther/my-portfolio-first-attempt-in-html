            <p>The phoenix means a lot to me. No matter what happens
                in life, even if the phoenix burns to ash, it rises the next morning, stronger than ever.
                Even the morning can only ever follow on the winds of the wings of the phoenix. The sunrise itself
                sparks to life by its fire and passion for life. </p>

            somwhere in there...
